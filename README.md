#Project Summary: Geospatial & Econometric Analysis of Household Data in Haryana

#Data Importing & Cleaning:

Utilized the State Wise Household 2011 Survey Data from the Survey of India website, extracting and cleaning data for Haryana.
Transformed and computed new indices to prepare the data for geospatial analysis.

#Digitization:

Employed qGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) for digitization, using shape files of India states and overlaying them with a tiff file of Haryana for district-wise boundaries.
Manually traced polygons to create a digital map.

#Data Transformation:

Converted computed indexes into a CSV file and integrated them with the shape file to facilitate geospatial analysis.

#District Geospatial Analysis:

Utilized qGIS to create maps illustrating district-wise distribution of various household factors.
Explored Household Size, Sex Ratio, Female Work Participation Rate, and Scheduled Caste Population, identifying patterns and variations across districts.
Offered insights into the potential implications of observed patterns, such as the connection between household size and urbanization rate.
Econometric Analysis using GeoDa:

Employed GeoDa for econometric analysis, going beyond qGIS capabilities.
Conducted scatter plots and correlation analyses, revealing insights into relationships between variables.

#Key Findings:

Identified trends in household size, relating them to urbanization rates and employment in cultivation activities.
Uncovered disparities in sex ratio, female work participation, and scheduled caste population across districts.
Suggested potential policy implications based on the observed patterns.
Conclusion:

The project involved a comprehensive analysis of household data in Haryana, combining geospatial techniques with econometric analysis to uncover patterns and relationships.
Findings provide a basis for informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, social policies, and economic development.
Demonstrated proficiency in data manipulation, spatial analysis, and interpretation of socio-economic trends.
